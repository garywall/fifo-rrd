GWFL FIFO-RRD README
--------------------

1. Purpose

FIFO-RRD's function is simple, by no means a new concept. Read data
from a FIFO and use that data to create and/or update RRDs.

2. Requirements

* Perl 5
* Standard Libc headers
* The following Perl modules:
	POSIX, FindBin, File::Basename, File::Spec::Functions, RRDs

3. Compiling and Installation

a) make
b) mv /path/to/installation/directory /usr/lib/fifo-rrd (or wherever)
c) Init scripts are provided for Debian, Gentoo & RHEL3 (in sysscripts)
d) Logrotate script is provided (in sysscripts)
e) Configure rrd_templates.pm, template_config.pm, and fifo-rrd.pl
f) Make sure FIFO-RRD can write to the RRD storage directory, log 
   directory, and the pipe, as set in fifo-rrd.pl.

Refer to http://gwfl.daimonic.org/?p=doc for an implementation example.
